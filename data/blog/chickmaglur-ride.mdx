**pupps**:  _heyy, how has it been._

**me**: hi pupps, been good. How are you ?

**pupps**:  _I am my usual self, working hard !!_

**me**: ha

**pupps**:  _anyways, tell me a new cycling route. I want an easy one, and I know you would only do easy ones_  ü§≠

**me**: hehe, you know me. Anywhere for a downslope üöµ

**me**: I recently went near chikmaglur ‚Äî  [kottighera](https://goo.gl/maps/7f8yufviCnjXSdzv9)  üå´Ô∏èüåà

**pupps:** _oh! I love chikmaglur. Its like my weekend home. But never tried cycling. Tell me more !!!_

**me:** so,

**pupps:** _did you rent cycle there, i dint know you can rent cycle in chikmaglur. I mean it‚Äôs nice tourist place, bikes scooty yes. But cycles_ ü§î _???_

**pupps:** _did you go from Bangalore to chikmaglur on a cycle ??_ üòÆ

**me:** üôÑ, yeah act like Google auto complete. Let me explain‚Ä¶

I booked a sleeper bus. Many options are available on redbus. Kauveri bus travels is one of them which take cargo. They charge 700/- to take cycle as a cargo and provide good service.

I reached chikmaglur around 5 am. Got my cycle back. Stretched a bit on chikmaglur bus station. Chikmaglur bus station is nicely built, lots of space, clean washrooms.

**pupps:** _cool_

**me:** I started cycling around 5.40 am. It was still dark, so don‚Äôt forget to bring headlight and tail light for cycle. I have bought these from  [decathlon](https://www.decathlon.in/p/8405202/cycle-lights/cycling-light-front-rear-set-battery-st110)

**Pupps:** _tell me more about slopes please._

**me:** yeah, first 10km from chhikmaglur is upslope ‚Äî moderate difficult. Next 20km is nice downslopes, with great views. Final 25 km is mix of slopes. I honestly cribbed alot about it. But views were worth it !!

Day 1 ‚Äî chikmaglur to kottighera slope distribution

**Me**: Took a detour to  [dewarmane](https://goo.gl/maps/EwED5GwowPdNNiVR8). Its 10km upslope detour. Its really beautiful.

**Pupps:**  nope not doing 10km upslope ‚ùå

**Me:**  you can take auto. Its really beautiful. After that you will reach kottighera in about 4km. Kottighera views were worth all the upslopes.

**Me:**  started around 9am on day 2. Its not ideal, but I was waiting for delicious breakfast in my homestay üòÖ. 2nd day had opposite slope, downslope first and then the difficult upslopes part.

Luckily it rained while coming back, so upslope cycling dint feel too bad. Actually loved cycling in rain. And met this cutie on my way back

**pupps:** I am so doing this next weekend. One more thing, you would reach back to Bengaluru around 5 am, right ? Did you cycle back from bus stop to your place ?

**me:** that is an option, but I was way too tired to do that, and still half asleepü•±, so just booked cab to take my cycle back. You can book one from porter app to move your things.
