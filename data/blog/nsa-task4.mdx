## Introduction

The NSA Codebreak CTF challenge is a thrilling venture into cybersecurity and encryption. This article details Task 4, a pivotal part of the challenge, and briefly recaps the previous tasks.

## Task Summaries

### Task 1: Signal Analysis for the US Coast Guard

Analyzing an unregistered signal to find matches in the NSA database based on geographical coordinates and timestamps. 
Given a .db file, you are supposed to write a sql query which will find the anomalies and give the answer.

### Task 2: Embedded Device Interaction

Identifying the correct processor datasheet and physical pins for data transfer on an embedded device.

### Task 3: Kernel Decryption

Decrypting the device's kernel using a second-stage bootloader and a QEMU docker container.
You enter a `u-boot shell` and try to get the key value from the environment. Truns out its a s-box value, you would then read it with correct endianness and report the answer.

## Task 4: Decrypting the Encrypted Filesystem

### Problem Statement

Decrypting and mounting an encrypted filesystem from a USB device, using the device firmware and LUKS encryption.

Let's start with building the docker image, and run the qemu command as provided in the challenge 

```bash
export UBOOT=/myfiles/u-boot.bin
export DTB=/myfiles/device_tree.dtb
export KERNEL=/myfiles/kernel8.img
export DTB=/myfiles/bcm2710-rpi-3-b-plus.dtb
export SD_IMG=/myfiles/sd.img
export USB_IMG=/myfiles/usb.img

qemu-system-aarch64 -M raspi3b -m 1G -smp 4 -nographic -append "rw earlyprintk loglevel=8 console=ttyAMA0,115200 dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootdelay=1" -kernel $KERNEL -dtb $DTB -drive if=sd,index=0,format=raw,file=$SD_IMG -drive if=none,id=stick,format=raw,file=$USB_IMG -device usb-storage,drive=stick -netdev type=tap,id=usb0,script=/qemu-ifup,downscript=/qemu-ifdown -device usb-net,netdev=usb0 -netdev type=tap,id=usb1,script=no,downscript=no -device usb-net,netdev=usb1
```

This spins up the emulated rpi3+ device in the docker container. In the startup logs, you can see its starting from /etc/init.d directory. Contents of that file is 

```bash
#!/bin/sh

mount -t proc none /proc
mount -t sysfs none /sys
/sbin/mdev -s
mount -a

for drv in /drivers/*.ko; do
  insmod $drv
done

[ -s /etc/hostname ] && hostname `cat /etc/hostname`

PRIV_IP=10.101.255.254

ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1 netmask 255.0.0.0
ifconfig lo up
ifconfig usb0 $PRIV_IP netmask 255.255.0.0
ifconfig usb0 up

ifconfig usb1 up
udhcpc -i usb1 -s /etc/udhcpc.script -b &

/sbin/dropbear -p $PRIV_IP:22

/opt/mount_part /dev/sda2 /private /opt/part.enc /agent
#(/agent/start >/dev/null 2>&1) &
```

Its running a script /opt/mount_part to mount the /opt/part.enc to /agent directory. But failing as /opt/mount_part script requires correct password.
Contents of /opt/mount_part script 

```bash
#!/bin/sh

SEC_DRIVE=$1
SEC_MOUNT=$2
ENC_PARTITION=$3
ENC_MOUNT=$4

[ ! -e $ENC_PARTITION ] && { echo "encrypted partition not found"; exit 1; }

mkdir -p $SEC_MOUNT
mount $SEC_DRIVE $SEC_MOUNT
NAME=`hostname`
ID=`cat /private/id.txt`

DATA="${NAME}${ID:0:3}"
echo "cryptsetup: opening $ENC_PARTITION"
echo -n $DATA | openssl sha1 | awk '{print $NF}' | cryptsetup open $ENC_PARTITION part
mkdir -p $ENC_MOUNT
mount /dev/mapper/part $ENC_MOUNT
```

Its reading /private/id.txt file for part of password and with help of that generating the encryption password. Obvioulsy /private/id.txt file has nothing, and now we know what is the task 4 all about. 

Looking closely at the script, you can check only 3 characters are required from `/private/id.txt` file. Looks easy enough. To bruteforce first 3 chars for the password. 

The actual know-how starts here. 
#### 1. figure out the encryption setup for the encrypted file system 
    Most file systems are encrypted with luks for rpi3+ devices. We need to confirm if the given encrypted blob is one from luks 
```bash
cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sdb3
``` 
it will output the encryption-type used and slots used for the encryption. A very good LUKS understanding document is [here(https://diverto.github.io/2019/11/18/Cracking-LUKS-passphrases)] 

#### 2. Start passwords for bruteforcing - after all its only 3 chars 
```bash
hashcat --stdout -a 3 drypush?a?a?a > passwords.txt
```
remember that the passphrase to find is not directly "drypush???".
It's derived from that by applying SHA-1 and then used as a passphrase for LUKS.
We need an intermediary step to compute the SHA-1 of each generated password and then use those SHA-1 outputs to try and decrypt the LUKS header. Once after generating the passwords, we can use hashcat to decrypt with this command 

To crack a LUKS header, the LUKS passphrase is derived from a SHA-1 hash of some input.
The script /opt/mount_part takes the hostname, concatenates it with the first 3 characters of some ID, then takes the SHA-1 hash of that string, and uses the hash as the passphrase to decrypt a LUKS partition.
Let's try to replicate this process with Hashcat:

1. Generate potential candidates (the combination of hostname and the first three characters of id.txt).
```bash
hashcat --stdout -a 3 drypush?a?a?a > raw_combinations.txt
```
2. Hash each of these candidates using SHA-1.
```bash
while read line; do echo -n "$line" | openssl dgst -sha1; done < raw_combinations.txt > hashed_combinations.txt
```
3. Use the resulting SHA-1 hashes as potential passphrases against the LUKS header
```bash
hashcat -m 14600 recieved.bin hashed_combinations.txt
```

#### 3. Running the above on my laptop (NVIDIA RTX A6000)
```bash

`Recovered........: 1/2 (50.00%) Digests, 1/2 (50.00%) Salts` --> tells we have recovered 1st slot from LUKS header. Thats all we wanted, as the 1st slot passphrase was required to decrypt the 2nd slot.

Problem solved.
