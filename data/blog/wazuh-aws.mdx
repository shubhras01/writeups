summary: Save aws cost- ingesting AWS GuardDuty events in wazuh dashboard
---


**What is Wazuh:**  Wazuh is open source security platform. It provides endpoint-security, security intelligence, cloud security etc. Wazuh relies on  [ossec model](https://github.com/ossec)  for generating an alert.

We can integrate multiple cloud security services, and index data to wazuh indexer, which can then provide a comprehensive view for the overall system-security.

**What is GuardDuty:** [AWS GuardDuty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/)  is a service by aws, which continuously montiors aws accounts and activities to montior and detect malicious activity.

**How to ingest GuardDuty findings to Wazuh :** Wazuh provides a very detailed  [document](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/amazon/services/supported-services/guardduty.html)  for integrating aws services to wazuh-dashboard. Essentially guardduty stores all the finidngs in s3 bucket. A kinesis-firehose stream will be subscribed to the s3 bucket and stores data in another s3 bucket.

Wazuh suggested flow looks like below

> _Guardduty → kinesis → firehose → s3 bucket_

However, wazuh aws-s3 plugin ([opensource code](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/blob/master/wodles/aws/aws_s3.py)) is reading a s3 bucket and parses data in kinesis events format. We can read data from guardduty events, transform it in wazuh-expected format and put it to another bucket. This final bucket will be read by wazuh aws-s3 plugin and then indexed by wazuh-indexer.

Updated flow looks like below

> _Guardduty findings → s3 bucket_guardduty → cron job to transform events to kinesis events format → s3 bucket_wazuh_in_

Here are the steps for setup:

1.  Setup guardduty to send all findings / events to a s3 bucket, lets call it **guardduty-findings-s3-bucket**
2.  Setup a cron job which will turn these events to kinesis data format, a simple function which will add fields required by wazuh aws-s3 wodle, is given below.
```python
def get_kinesis_format(guard_duty_events):  
  tmp = ""  
  for event_data in guard_duty_events:  
    tmp += json.dumps({"detail": event_data, "source": "guardduty"})  
  return tmp
  ```

3. Keep track of how many files you have visited in your cron script, by adding a marker-file in s3, lets call it  **wazuh-marker** bucket. Next cron job will first read marker-file and picks up s3 objects after the marker
Simple way to query s3 bucket will include parameters like
``
"filter_args" = {  
            'Bucket': <bucket>,  
            'MaxKeys': <num_keys_to_fetch_in_single_pass>,  
            'Prefix': <prefix>  
            'StartAfter': <filter_marker>  
        }
        ``


4. This cron-job will read data from guardduty s3 bucket and transforms data in kinesis event format. It will put it in the bucket which will be read by wazuh-manager. Lets call this output bucket as  **wazuh-transformed.**

5. Now setup the wazuh configuration. Basic settings parameters looks like this in official documents
```json
<wodle name="aws-s3">  
  <disabled>no</disabled>  
  <interval>10m</interval>  
  <run_on_start>yes</run_on_start>  
  <skip_on_error>yes</skip_on_error>  
  <bucket type="guardduty">  
    <name>wazuh-aws-wodle</name>  
    <path>wazuh-transformed/</path>  
    <aws_profile>default</aws_profile>  
  </bucket>  
</wodle>
```

By default wazuh plugin will read s3 bucket every 10 minutes, but we can change this setting to process more real time events.

6. wazuh-wodle aws-s3 will read the bucket and indexe the data in the opensearch, where it is further consumed by default dashboards.

The whole setup relies on the fact that wazuh aws-s3 plugin reads data in kinesis event format. This will work like a charm, without having to setup kinesis-firehose stream.

Wazuh community is working towards launching a support for reading data directly from guardduty. Will be released in further versions. Till then we can transform the data and see it on wazuh dashboard.
