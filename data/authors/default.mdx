Hey there! I'm a full-stack developer with a background in building search systems for startups in India. I've now shifted gears towards specializing in cybersecurity and I'm currently pursuing my MS degree at Georgia Tech.

When I'm not coding, you'll often find me on my bike or exploring hiking trails. I'm all about blending technical know-how with real-world solutions.

Let's team up and create cool stuff together. Looking forward to connecting with you!
